# Toy Robot Simulator
My solutions to the Toy Robot Simulator coding challenge

## Usage
The program expects to receive commands from standard input and send the results to standard output. For example, test case 1 could be run like this when in project root directory:
```
cat test_data/case1.log | ruby/lib/toy_robot
```

## Testing
Run the tests by going to ruby directory and use rake:
```
cd ruby
rake
```
